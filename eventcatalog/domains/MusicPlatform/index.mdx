## Overview

The Music Platform synchronizes catalog metadata across two bounded contexts:

- **Music Service (Java/Spring Boot):** exposes REST + SSE APIs, persists songs, and publishes the `music.song-created` event whenever the catalog changes.
- **Video Enricher (.NET):** listens to new songs, scrapes YouTube metadata, and emits `music.video-found` once a matching video is found.

The domain promotes strict contract governance with AsyncAPI specs generated straight from code (SpringWolf & Neuroglia). EventCatalog hosts the curated documentation plus the JSON/YAML snapshots captured in `specs/` via the `sync:asyncapi` script.

## Event Flow

1. A client registers a song through the Music Service REST API.
2. Music Service publishes `SongCreatedEvent` (`music.song-created`).
3. Video Enricher consumes the message, enriches metadata, and publishes `VideoFoundEvent` (`music.video-found`).
4. Music Service ingests the enrichment event to finalize the song profile sent to downstream listeners via SSE.
