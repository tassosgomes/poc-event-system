## Payload

```json
{
  "songId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "videoUrl": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123",
  "views": 450003
}
```

- `videoUrl` always points to the canonical YouTube video selected by the enrichment process.
- `views` captures the snapshot at enrichment time; replays should treat it as informational only.

## Contract Source
